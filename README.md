# Write-it-Foget-it-
Project for UofTHacksIX

## Inspiration
- We decided to build a website that a user could use to relieve any anxiety or stress they might be experiencing, in the name of restoration! 
## What it does
- Our project is a website that allows users to write anything on a page, and then click on a menu bar to destroy whatever was written, so they can forget about it! 
## How we built it
- This project was built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We hosted the website on Replit and used it as a medium to code together. 
## Challenges we ran into
- Being that neither of us had much experience in these languages, especially JavaScript, working with CSS alignment as well as functions in JavaScript was most difficult, but also where we learned the most. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The places where we saw challenges are the same places where we learned the technology to overcome them. For example, we learned how to use events in JavaScript and dynamic CSS styling for the first time to implement certain things like the pop-up fire. 
## What we learned
- The point of this project was to learn the basics of web development, it was difficult to code the animations with vanilla JavaScript but it was a learning experience. 
## What's next for Write it! Forget it!
- To implement the other two buttons, and rewrite some of the CSS to make the web page more inviting.
